Content Licensing
=================

Like Data Management source code, DM technical documentation is free and open and we welcome contributions to it from both inside and outside the LSST Project.

All DM documentation content is licensed under the `Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)`_ license.
This license enables our users to freely share and adapt documentation content.
(For example, a professor can adapt DM documentation into course material.)
The ‘attribution’ clause ensures that LSST is acknowledged.

All DM metadata is licensed under a `Creative Commons Zeros (CC0)`_ license.
This enables bibliographic services to list DM documentation.
(Archive and bibliographic services assume this. See the `Zenodo terms of use`_, for example.)

Source code for DM documentation infrastructure is licensed under an appropriate open source license consistent with the DM open-source licensing policies.
