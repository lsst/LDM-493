Documentation Taxonomy
======================

Data Management uses and produces multiple classes of documentation.
Each class fulfills a specific role, with a consistent management and technical process.

.. _taxonomy-outline:

Document classes
----------------

The classes of DM documentation are:

Requirements and interface control documentation (LPM, LSE)
   These documents specify functionality that the Data Management System must deliver to the Project.
   Similarly, **interface control documents** are agreements between subsystems on functionality that cross subsystem boundaries.
   The production of this documentation is described in `LPM-19: Change Control Process`_ and its management is described in `LPM-51: Document Management Plan`_.

Change-controlled DM design documentation (LDM)
   These documents define the **scope** and **budget** of Data Management work that meet the **requirements** and **interface control documentation**.
   DM work is expected to be consistent with these **design documents**.
   LDM document authors are responsible for updating design documentation whenever necessitated by revised project requirements, or by evolving implementation choices.
   DM design documents must be approved by the DM Technical Control Team before becoming the new baseline.
   These documents are also governed by `LPM-51: Document Management Plan`_.
   See :ref:`ldm` for how change-controlled documents are handled by the Data Management Documentation Architecture.

Technical notes (DMTN, SQR)
   Technical notes are a standardized, durable, document series allowing useful information to be published on demand by any Data Management team member wishing to capture and share knowledge.
   Common uses of **technical notes** are descriptions of experiments with code or data, reviews of literature or technologies, usage notes, or technical documents that are too limited to trigger the change-control process.
   The primary audiences of **technical notes** are DM team members who build, maintain, or interface with a system and the science community.
   See :ref:`technotes` for details.

User guides (DMG)
   These documentation products describe usage of DM software, platforms, and data products to end-users.
   Typically, end-users are astronomers in the scientific community.
   Some **user guides** may instead be considered internal, such as **operational guides** or **developer guides**.
   The most important aspect of **user guides** is that they are written intentionally for their intended audience.
   See :ref:`guides` for details.

Validation documents
   These documents report the Data Management System's performance, particularly with respect to key performance metrics defined in `LPM-17: Science Requirements Document`_.
   Validation documents are primarily generated by automated Quality Control (QC) services, which are part of the SDQA system (see ยง6 of `LDM-151: Data Management Application Design`_).
   LSST Systems Engineering is the primary consumer of DM validation documentation in construction and commissioning, though these reports are also valuable to the DM team and the LSST science community.

Publications
   Publications---namely journal articles, and conference presentations and proceedings---speak directly to the science community.
   With respect to the Data Management Documentation Architecture, publications should be a synthesis of DM documentation products (Design Documents, Implementation Technical Notes, Technical Notes, and User Guides).
   Publications are described in `LPM-162: Project Publication Policy`_.

.. _taxonomy-flow:

Information flow down
---------------------

DM's documentation taxonomy facilitates a flow of information from research and design, to implementation, and finally to operations.

   Idealized information flow across documentation classes.

As :numref:`fig-information-flow` illustrates, the scope and functionality of the Data Management System is specified by Requirements Documents.
Design documents translate requirements into actionable designs and documentation of system implementations.
Designs are reflected in :ref:`change controlled design documents (LDM) <ldm>`, though details can be deferred to :ref:`technical notes (DMTN, SQR) <technotes>`.
:ref:`User guides <guides>` are written for end users using a combination of information from the design documentation and the implemented software itself.
Verification documentation is written as a consequence of testing activities.
Finally, scientific publications are written as a holistic synthesis of the entire Data Management System for the community.

Note that this is an *idealized* linear information flow. 
Software development work will spur new :ref:`technical notes <technotes>` that in turn create revise design documentation.
However, :numref:`fig-information-flow` shows the role of each document class in supporting the Data Management System in reporting research, documenting designs, and documenting for users.
